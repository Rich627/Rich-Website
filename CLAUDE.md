# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is Rich Liu's personal portfolio website - a modern Next.js 15 application with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development server (with Turbopack)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production server
npm run start

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

The development server runs on http://localhost:3000

## Architecture

### Application Structure

- **Entry Point**: `src/app/page.tsx` - Composes all components into the homepage
- **Layout**: `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with metadata, fonts (Geist Sans/Mono), Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Analytics
- **Components** (`src/components/`):
  - `Navbar.tsx` - Navigation with social links
  - `Intro.tsx` - Hero section with introduction and AWS Community Builder badge
  - `Certificates.tsx` - Certification badges showcase
  - `SkillSet.tsx` - Skills overview with badges
  - `SkillLevels.tsx` - Detailed skill proficiency levels
  - `Experience.tsx` - Work experience timeline
  - `Projects.tsx` - Portfolio projects showcase with NDA handling
  - `Blog.tsx` - Medium articles integration
  - `Footer.tsx` - Contact information and footer

### Static Assets

Located in `public/`:
- `/css/` - Custom styles (style.css, redesign.css)
- `/img/` - Images organized by type:
  - `certifiacate/` - Certification badges (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - `logo/` - Brand logos and intro image
  - `project/` - Project screenshots (ai-psy-test, aws-educate-tpet, gogoro-ai, taylor-swift-workshop, advantech-rd, viewsonic-caf)
  - `skill-set/` - Skill category icons
  - `icon/` - UI icons
- `/js/` - Legacy JavaScript files (progressbar.js, speedNumber.js, name.js)

### Styling Approach

The app uses a **hybrid styling approach**:
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling
- **Bootstrap 5.3.2** loaded via CDN for layout and components
- **Custom CSS** files in `/public/css/` for legacy styles
- **Font Awesome 5.15** for icons

### Configuration

- **TypeScript**: Target ES2017, strict mode enabled
- **Path Aliases**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- **Next.js**: Version 15.3.2 with React 19
- **ESLint**: Next.js core-web-vitals and TypeScript rules

## Deployment

### AWS S3 Static Website Hosting

```bash
# Build the static site
npm run build

# Sync to S3 bucket
aws s3 sync out/ s3://rich-liu.com --region ap-northeast-1

```

**S3 Configuration:**
